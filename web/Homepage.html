      <div id="intro" class="paragraph">My name is John Memmott.  I am originally from the great state of Utah, but have more recently been residing in Arizona.  Nothing like going from cool summer nights, mountains, and fluffy snow to hot, desert, hot summers, mild winters (for about two weeks) and then back to hot.  I am studying at Brigham Young University and majoring in their Software Engineering program.  I have been married since August of 2012 and we have 3 beautiful children.  I enjoy spending time with my family and playing games with them.  I love reading books, specifically Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels.  I love watching movies with my wife and binging on a good sitcom.
